  <h2>OpenAPI TL;DR</h2>
  <p>The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a <mark>standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs</mark> which
    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source
    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.</p>
  <p>When properly defined, a consumer can <mark>understand</mark> and <mark>interact</mark> with the remote service
    with a <mark>minimal amount of implementation logic</mark>.</p>
